# Story 1.5: 基础的错误与异常处理

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**作为一个** 系统,
**我想要** 在自动化过程中优雅地处理常见错误（如页面加载失败、元素未找到）,
**以便于** 提升自动化脚本的稳定性，并为失败提供有意义的反馈。

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Playwright的关键操作被包含在try-except块中。
2. 当找不到关键页面元素时，程序能捕获异常并报告"元素未找到"的错误。
3. 当注册因已知原因（如"用户名已被占用"）失败时，程序能识别并返回具体原因。
4. 故事1.3的CLI能显示这些具体的错误信息。

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Implement comprehensive exception handling in automation service (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Add try-except blocks around all Playwright operations
  - [x] Create specific exception classes for different error types
  - [x] Implement element not found error detection and reporting
  - [x] Add timeout handling for page operations
  - [x] Create error logging mechanism for debugging

- [x] Task 2: Implement specific registration failure detection (AC: 3)
  - [x] Add logic to detect "用户名已被占用" error messages
  - [x] Create error classification system for different failure types
  - [x] Implement page content analysis for error message extraction
  - [x] Add fallback error handling for unrecognized failures

- [x] Task 3: Enhance CLI error reporting capabilities (AC: 4)
  - [x] Modify CLI interface to display detailed error messages
  - [x] Update main.py argument parsing to handle error reporting modes
  - [x] Implement structured error output formatting
  - [x] Add verbose error logging option for debugging

- [x] Task 4: Comprehensive unit testing for error handling (Testing Strategy)
  - [x] Write unit tests for all exception handling scenarios
  - [x] Create mock tests for Playwright failures
  - [x] Test error message extraction and classification
  - [x] Validate CLI error reporting functionality

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.4: CLI interface successfully established using argparse with main.py routing pattern. AccountGenerator class patterns can be extended for error handling in automation operations.

### Architecture Context
**MVVM Pattern Compliance**: Error handling should follow established MVVM architecture with service layer managing exceptions and ViewModel coordinating error reporting to UI layers [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#7.4].

**Service Layer Error Management**: AutomationService should be the primary location for exception handling logic, maintaining separation between business logic and presentation [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#7.4].

### File Locations
Based on project source tree structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- **Primary Error Handling**: `src/services/automation_service.py` - Core automation exception handling
- **CLI Integration**: `main.py` - CLI error reporting enhancement  
- **Error Classes**: `src/models/` - Custom exception classes if needed
- **Unit Tests**: `tests/` - Following established testing patterns from Story 1.4

### Testing Requirements
**Unit Testing Strategy**: Service layer error handling requires independent unit tests with mock Playwright failures [Source: architecture/test-strategy.md#10.1].

**Testing Coverage**: Must include Model layer validation, Service layer business logic, and integration testing for complete error flows [Source: architecture/test-strategy.md#10.1, 10.2].

### Technical Constraints
**Security Consideration**: Full error handling mechanism is required for application security compliance [Source: architecture/security.md#11.2].

**Python Version**: Use Python 3.12 compatible exception handling patterns [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md].

**Playwright Integration**: Error handling must be compatible with Playwright ~1.44 automation framework [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md].

### Project Structure Notes
No structural conflicts identified. Error handling implementation aligns with established MVVM service layer pattern and existing CLI architecture from previous stories.

## Testing
### Testing Standards
**Test File Location**: All test files must be placed in `tests/` directory following established project structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md].

**Testing Framework**: Use pytest ~8.2 for unit testing following established patterns from Story 1.4 [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md].

**Test Categories Required**:
- **Service Layer Tests**: Independent testing of error handling logic in AutomationService [Source: architecture/test-strategy.md#10.1]
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end error handling flow from CLI to service layer [Source: architecture/test-strategy.md#10.2]
- **Mock Testing**: Simulated Playwright failures and exception scenarios
