# Database Schema

_This section contains database schema definitions based on the data models._

## Schema Design

The project uses local file-based storage with CSV format for account data persistence. No traditional database schema is required for the current implementation.

### Data Persistence Strategy
- **Account Data**: CSV files with user-defined structure
- **Configuration**: Local settings files
- **Temporary Data**: In-memory storage during batch operations

### Future Considerations
If database requirements emerge, consider:
- SQLite for local desktop database needs
- PostgreSQL for potential web-based deployment
- NoSQL options for flexible data structures
