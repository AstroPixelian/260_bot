# Next Steps

_This section outlines the next steps after completing the architecture document._

## Immediate Next Actions

### 1. Architecture Validation
- Review architecture document with stakeholders
- Validate technical decisions against project requirements
- Confirm technology stack choices

### 2. Development Setup
- Initialize development environment according to source tree structure
- Set up build tools and dependencies as specified in tech stack
- Configure development tools and IDE settings

### 3. Implementation Planning
- Begin story implementation using the defined architecture patterns
- Set up testing infrastructure according to test strategy
- Implement coding standards and development workflows

## Future Considerations

### Frontend Architecture (If Needed)
Currently not required as this is a desktop PySide6 application, but if web interface is needed:

```
*create-doc front-end-architecture-tmpl
```

### DevOps and Infrastructure
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and building
- Configure deployment processes for different environments
- Implement monitoring and logging infrastructure

## Development Team Handoff

### For AI Development Agents
- Use the coding-standards.md section as mandatory development guidelines
- Follow the architectural patterns defined in this document
- Implement security requirements as specified
- Adhere to the defined test strategy

### For Human Developers
- Review architecture document thoroughly before beginning development
- Follow established patterns and conventions
- Contribute to architectural decision records for any changes
